# xcfunctions.js

XComponent.Functions JS client library

Since version 5.0, XComponent allows one to implement microservices in any programming language. This is done by means of the new  *REST*  triggered methods; in opposition to the standard *Native* ones, generated automatically by XComponent's build tool chain and implemented in C#.

REST triggered methods are implemented by any programming language able to speak REST.

The present library abstracts away from the REST protocol and allows developers to write code that reads and behaves very close to the way triggered methods were traditionally written.
